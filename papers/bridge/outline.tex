% \section{Project Outline}
% In this project, we plan to support retrieving data from ten EVM-based blockchains.
% Section~\ref{subsec:blockchain_selection} lists the nine blockchains 
% and the reasons for selecting them.
% Once we are able to retrieve data from these blockchains, we will
% examine cross-chain transactions across bridges that have been 
% exploited before. 
% Specifically, for all applicable bridges, we will retrospectively examine 
% all transactions prior to their exploitation.
% We expect to at least identify the publicly reported malicious transactions. 
% Prior work~\cite{zhang2022xscope} also identified 
% additional suspicious transactions that were previously unknown.
% We expect to identify these transactions as well.

% Concretely, for each hacked bridge, we retrospectively examine \textit{all} transactions until a day after the last known exploit transaction.


% \subsection{Retrospective Analysis}


% \subsection{Timeline}
% We will add support for all ten blockchains by the end of February 25th. \textit{Importantly, this part hinges on everyone's effort besides the project lead.} From February 26th to March 4th, we will collect all the transactions and store them in a database. We will perform the retrospective analysis and write the paper from March 4th to March 21st (the day of presentation).
